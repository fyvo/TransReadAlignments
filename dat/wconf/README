LIMSI word alignment confidence annotation corpus
A collection of confidence annotations of word alignment links.

This resource has been produced in the course of the TransRead
Project (https://transread.limsi.fr) funded by the French National
Research Agency under contract ANR-12-CORD-0015.

Please cite the following paper if you use the resource in your research:

Yong Xu and François Yvon (2016). Novel elicitations and annotation schemes for sentential 
and sub-sentential alignments of bi-texts. Proceedings of 10th Language 
Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC 2016). Portorož (Slovenia).

CONTENT/STRUCTURE

All documents for one language pair (e.g. English_French) are stored in one directory.
Each directory contains one or more sub-directories, each corresponding to one task.

In one task, tokenized parallel text is stored in one file. Annotations are stored
in seperated files. For certain tasks, multiple annotators have annotated the same 
parallel text. In this case, the annotations of one annotator are stored in one file.

Note: in the annotations, word index begins at 0. 

Please refer to the aforementioned paper for the semantic of annoation tags.

Statistics (if multiple annotators accomplished the same task, they all annotated the same
amount of links. For example, the first line of the English-French table means all 3 annoators have
annotated 2189 links):
